<p>HTML, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language</a>, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.
To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:</p><p>Hypertext: text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
<br>Markup: a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format<br>Language: a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.
</p><p>HTML determines the structure of web pages.<br>This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.</p>
